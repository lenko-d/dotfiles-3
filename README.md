# Dotfiles

This repository contains my barebones toolbelt and configuration for OSX and
Linux. Feel free to fork it and customize all you want.

## Installation

It's just a matter of cloning and running the install script. It will install
Stack and some other basic stuff, as well as symlink the dotfiles.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:owickstrom/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
