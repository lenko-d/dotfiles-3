# Dotfiles

This repository contains my barebones toolbelt and configuration for OSX and
Linux. Feel free to fork it and customize all you want.

## Installation

First download and install the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

Then it's just a matter of cloning and running the Main script.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:owickstrom/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/Main.hs
```
